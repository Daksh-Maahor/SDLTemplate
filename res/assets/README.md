This directory is for game assets (images, sounds, etc.).

Example usage:
- Place PNG, JPG, or other supported image files here
- Reference them in your code as "res/assets/filename.png"
- The res/ directory is automatically copied to the build directory during CMake configuration

Supported image formats (via SDL2_image):
- PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP, TGA, TIFF, WebP, and more

Note: Make sure to handle cases where assets might not be found in your code.
